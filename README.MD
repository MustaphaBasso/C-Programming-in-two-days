If you're a beginner who wishes to learn C programming, go through these exercises in sequences from number 1 all the way to the end.
Within each folder, you'll find numbered exercises.  Again, go through the exercises from the first (number 1) till the last,  Read the code and the comments, then run the code.  As you progress through the exercises you'll gain more experience to do more complex programs.
If you're an advanced programmer, you can still use the exercises as a refresher or as reference.
