If you're a beginner who wishes to learn C programming, go through these exercises in sequence from number 1 all the way to the end.
Within each folder, you'll find numbered exercises.  Again, go through the exercises from the first (number 1) till the last,  Read the code and the comments, then run the code.  As you progress through the exercises you'll gain more experience to do more complex programs.
If you're an advanced programmer, you can still use the exercises as a refresher or as reference.

In order to compile and run these programs, you can do so either by using an IDE such as VSCode, Eclipse (or any other) depending on your OS, or by opening a command or bash terminal in the appropriate directory containing the program file(s).  Consult your compiler documentation for the appropriate command syntax.  Example, for gnu compiler in windows, you would issue the following command line:  
      gcc filename.c  -o filname.exe.
For a clang compiler, 
      cl square.c calc.c -o square.exe.
      
etc...
Make sure your environment variable are exported properly, and they point to the appropriate paths to the c libraries and include files.

After successful compilation, run the executable by invoking it at the command line.
