A variable is a named data storage location in computer memory.
The name can contain letters, digits, and the underscore character.
The first character of the name must be letter.
Case matters.
C keywords cannot be used as variable name.
Memory is measured in bytes.
Each byte consists of 8 bits.
A bit is a binary digit with value of either 1 or 0.
